                    And there is a time for every event under heaven -- 
                    A time to give birth and a time to die; 
                    A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal; 
                    A time to tear down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh; 
                    A time to mourn and a time to dance.
                    A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; 
                    A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing. 
                    A time to search and a time to give up as lost; 
                    A time to keep and a time to throw away. 
                    A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; 
                    A time to be silent and a time to speak. 
                    A time to love and a time to hate; 
                    A time for war and a time for peace" Ecclesiastes 3:1 -8

                    The first weekend in November we traveled to Austin and had a great time 
                    catching up with some of Joey's family. 
                    We had good food, laughs and enjoyed walking around 
                    some of the scenic places. We also saw the movie Overcomer which was really 
                    good with a good mix of positivity and mystery.

                            In the midst of this month, Hannah's uncle Dave, who had been battling cancer, 
                            passed away. We attended his memorial service and were thankful to 
                            have known him. Hannah knew Uncle Dave as long as she can remember, and would
                            typically see him around the holidays and at birthday parties. She has fond
                            memories of him loving to carry on conversations and talking to just about anyone.
                            He will be greatly missed!

                            Prior to leaving town to see more family, we spent time with some family 
                            from Antioch and participated in a Friendsgiving. 
                            It was a lot of fun and the time spent in fellowship and 
                            light-hearted activity really helped lighten our hearts.

                            Near the end of the month we travelled to Louisiana to spend Thanksgiving with Joey's mom, 
                            grandfather and some aunts and uncles along with his brother. 
                            As is expected there was much food and fellowship, naps and football. 
                            While we were there we also went painting and had a really great time!
