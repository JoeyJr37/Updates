      <h3> October 2019 </h3>
      <p>Continuing in the season of September of being stretched by our schedule, 
        October filled up quickly and flew by just as fast. Activity filled our week nights and our weekends 
        but it was all really good! Our typical week looked like meeting with friends for disciplship, game nights and dinners. </p>
      <h3>Family time</h3>
      <p>The first weekend of October, Hannah went to a baby shower for her sister-in-law (who has since 
        then welcomed into her family a baby boy!). The shower was a fun time of being with family, celebrating with her sister-in-law 
        (also named Hannah) and it was an 
        honor to pray over baby Barrett. Both Hannah and Joey joined the rest of her family the following day to take pictures! </p>

        <h3>Outreach Weekend</h3>
      <p>On the next weekend, we were blessed with the opportunity to minister in Gulfton with others from the Antioch Training School class. 
          This is the class we participate in as a part of the staff every Sunday evening. Gulfton is a unique place in Houston that is home 
          to around 50,000 people, of which 67% are non-English speakers. It's one of the most densely populated homes for refugees in the U.S. 
          and a large percentage of the people there represent people groups who have never heard about Jesus or the gospel.</p>
          <p>We partnered with an 
          amazing couple who have become fast friends and the four of us were able to pray for and share the love of Jesus with some of the 
          residents there during that weekend. 
          Amazingly we also found a coffee shop with authentic indian chai tea and it reminded us of our time back in India!</p>

      <h3>5k & Unbound</h3>
      <p>The following weekend Hannah participated in a 5k with Unbound and it was great! </p>

        <p>
       This is a great time to mention that during this month Hannah also started the process of getting her business up and running! 
       It's a small made-to-order dessert business and while we're still figuring out the ropes of how to do this, she's committed to 
       seeing a portion of the profits go directly to supporting anti-human trafficking efforts in Houston and throughout the world.</p>
      <p>We're still working on her website but you can visit this one to see the current version! If you're in the Houston area feel free to 
      submit an order! <a href="http://www.just-desserts.xyz" target="_blank">Just Desserts</a> 
      (It looks a little nicer on a mobile phone than a desktop in our opinion)      </p>
        <h3> Life Long Friends</h3>
        <p> Hannah got a chance to visit with one of her life long friends this month! Evelyn and Hannah have been friends since 
          high school and since they live in different states they aren't able to see each other often but when they do it's a great time!

      <h3>Cats</h3>
      <p>We were also blessed to be able to go to a musical (Cats) and it was very interesting. While we would like to see more 
      musicals we likely won't be seeing that one again. </p>

      <p>In the midst of our weekends, Joey was given the opportunity to speak to a group of young men about stewardship. 
        It's a topic he's really passionate about and it was a blessing to be able to share his thoughts with others. 
        It's something he's always willing to talk about so definitely ask him about it if you're curious. 
        Maybe he'll send you his notes! He's been told that he has teaching & writing in his genes and is starting to believe it. 
        Both of his parents recently released books that are now available online! 
        You can view the first one <a href="https://store.bookbaby.com/book/pressing-on-toward-maturity" target="_blank">here</a> 
        and the second one <a href="https://store.bookbaby.com/book/from-his-word-to-my-heart" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>That's the end of the month of October! November is here and there's christmas music already playing in the Perry household! We are incredibly thankful for this life we get to live on mission with God and in partnership with His people and during the month of November we will be traveling to see family in Austin and Louisiana as well as having some friendsgivings in the midst of those trips. Thanks for reading and as always, let us know how you're doing! We want to hear from you!</p>
