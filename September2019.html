<h2>September: A season of Development</h2>
<h3> So it begins… </h3>
<p>
True confessions: We vastly underestimated the spare time available to us while it was summer! As the seasons shift and we switch gears into the fall, our calendar space has evaporated and seemingly all our time is spoken for. That's not to say we are busy for the sake of busyness because there is purpose with everything we do, but we are learning the wisdom behind calendar margin and having time set apart to

<p>
As of now our typical week includes:

<li> A discussion group about  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Leadership-Principles-Excellence-Believer/dp/0802416705?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-d-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0802416705" target="_blank">
this book</a> </li>

<li>Gathering with other believers in lifegroup to worship, pray and study the Bible</li>
<li> A night for meal planning, grocery shopping and general cleaning around the house </li>
<li> A night for homework (see below for more info on this) </li>
</ul>

Keep reading for how we've been spending our weekends!
</p>

<h3> Labor Day Weekend! </h3>
<p>We both received time off on that Monday so we spent time relaxing and praying about the fall and how to proceed into it. During this time Joey felt strongly to enroll in an online software & web development course</div> as a next step from the direction he received in the 30 day journal early in the year. One of the blessings of this course is that it is self-paced, which allows him to schedule when he’s doing the homework and assignments at his leisure. This turned out to be a really great feature due to what our month ended up looking like.  (In fact, this website is a result of what he has been learning!)
</p>

<h3> A Wonderful Waco Wedding </h3>
<p>
During the first weekend in September we traveled to Waco in celebration of a wedding! One of our previous team members from India, Daniel, met his wife there also (sound familiar?!). Daniel was Joey’s roommate while we were in India so it was a really great time of reconnecting and celebrating with them and also others from our India team who were able to join us! We orchestrated our stay through AirBnb and found out on the second day that our hosts were members of the Antioch in Waco! That was a great surprise the Lord organized for us, bringing together members of Antioch Houston and Antioch Waco through AirBnb!

Yes we know that the writing is backwards! It says "Welcome to our home Joey & Hannah"
</p>

<h3> Leadership Weekend! </h3>
<p>
The second weekend (September 13th-14th) we attended a leadership conference. It was a time of being developed as leaders and learning from very humble & wise elders within our church. During that weekend, the Lord invited us into a place of trusting in Him and His word in a way we previously weren’t walking in. Although it wasn’t the joy-filled celebration of the previous weekend, it was a time of pruning which lead to growth and we believe the lessons learned will continue to bear fruit in the future!
</p>

<h3> Do you remember? </h3>
<p>
September 20th-21st we were able to have a time of rest and have a Friday night date night! This is something we hadn’t done in a few weeks and it was a great time of intentional conversation and relational connection. The evening of September 21st we were invited to a small house party celebrating the 21st of September (based entirely on

It was a fun night filled with dancing and board games!

<h3> Supernatural Encouragement </h3>
<p>
September 27th-28th Joey travelled back to Waco with one of the pastors from Antioch and our lifegroup leader for a conference focusing on learning to encourage others through insights gained from the Spirit of God within us. It was a powerful time of equipping and we are more envisioned for praying and encouraging others. If you are in need of encouragement don’t hesitate to send us a quick response!

Coming up in October are a baby shower (not ours!!), meetings with other web developers, an outreach with ATS, a Glow In the Dark 5K and hopefully more pictures than we captured this month! We’re looking at another busy month but thankful for everything the Lord is doing in us and through us in this season. Also stay tuned next month for a special announcement about a business idea Hannah is working on! The picture above is your hint!
