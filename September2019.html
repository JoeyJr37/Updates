<h2>September: A season of Development</h2>
<h3> So it begins… </h3>
<p>
True confessions: We vastly underestimated the amount of time available to us while it was the 

summer! As the seasons start to shift and we switch gears into the fall, our calendar space 

evaporated and seemingly all our time is spoken for. I had a dream recently that someone moved 

into our house and started inviting their friends over until there were too many people to take 

care of. How did we get here? Let’s rewind back to September 1st!
</p>

<h3> Labor Day Weekend! </h3>
<p>We both received time off on that Monday so we spent time relaxing and praying about the 

fall and how to proceed into it. During this time Joey felt strongly to enroll in an online software 

& web development course as a next step from the direction he received in the 30 day journal 

early in the year. One of the blessings of this course is that it is self-paced, which allows him to 

schedule when he’s doing the homework and assignments at his leisure. This turned out to be a 

really great feature due to what our month ended up looking like. (In fact, this page is a result 

of what he has been learning!)
</p>

<h3> A Wonderful Waco Wedding </h3>
<p>
During the first weekend in September we traveled to Waco in celebration of a wedding! One of 

our previous team members from India, Daniel, met his wife there also (sound familiar?!). Daniel 

was Joey’s roommate while we were in India so it was a really great time of reconnecting and 

celebrating with them and also others from our India team who were able to join us! We 

orchestrated our stay through AirBnb and found out on the second day that our hosts were 

members of the Antioch in Waco! That was a great surprise to the Lord organized for us, to have 

been able to connect with members from the original church that our Antioch in Houston was 

planted out of. 
</p>

<h3> Leadership Weekend! </h3>
<p>
The second weekend (September 13th-14th) we attended a leadership conference. It was a time 

of being developed as leaders and learning from very humble & wise leaders within our church. 

During that weekend, the Lord invited us into a place of trusting in Him and His word in a way 

we previously weren’t walking in and although it wasn’t the joy-filled celebration of the previous 

weekend, it was a time of pruning we are confident has and will continue to lead toward spiritual 

growth.
</p>

<h3> Do you remember? </h3>
<p>
September 20th-21st we were able to have a time of rest and have a Friday night date night! This 

is something we hadn’t done in a few weeks and it was a great time of intentional conversation 

and relational connection. The evening of September 21st we were invited to a small house party 

celebrating the 21st of September (based entirely on 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs069dndIYk" target="_blank"> this </a> song).

It was a fun night filled with dancing and board games! 
</p>

<h3> Supernatural Encouragement </h3>
<p>
September 27th-28th Joey travelled back to Waco with one of the pastors from Antioch and our 

lifegroup leader Zach for a conference focusing on learning to encourage others through 

insights gained from the Spirit of God within us. It was a powerful time of equipping and we are 

more envisioned for praying and encouraging them. If you are in need of encouragement don’t 

hesitate to send us a quick response! 
</p>

<h3> What’s Next?!</h3>
<p>
Coming up in October are a baby shower, the beginnings of two discipleship groups, meetings 

with other web developers, an outreach with ATS and a Glow in the Dark 5k! We’re looking at 

another busy month but thankful for everything the Lord is doing in us and through us in this 

season.
