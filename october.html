                            Continuing in the season of September of being stretched by our schedule, October filled up quickly and flew by just as fast. 
                            Activity filled our week nights 
                            and our weekends but it was all really good! Our typical week looked like meeting with friends for discipleship, game nights and dinners.

                            The first weekend of October, Hannah went to a baby shower for her sister-in-law (who has since then welcomed into her family a baby boy!). 
                            The shower was a fun time of being with family, celebrating with her sister-in-law (also named Hannah) and it was an honor to pray over 
                            baby Barrett. Both Hannah and Joey joined the rest of her family the following day to take pictures!

                            <p>On the next weekend, we were blessed with the opportunity to minister in Gulfton with others from the Antioch Training School class. 
                            This is the class we participate in as a part of the staff every Sunday evening. Gulfton is a unique place in Houston that is home to 
                            around 50,000 people, of which 67% are non-English speakers. It's one of the most densely populated homes for refugees in the U.S. 
                            and a large percentage of the people there represent people groups who have never heard about Jesus or the gospel.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>We partnered with an amazing couple who have become fast friends and the four of us were able to pray for and share the 
                            love of Jesus with some of the residents there during that weekend. Amazingly we also found a coffee shop with authentic indian chai 
                            tea and it reminded us of our time back in India!</p>

                                    The following weekend Hannah participated in a 5k with Unbound and it was great!
                                    Hannah got second place in her division!
                                    Unbound is an anti-human trafficking organization working throughout the Houston area to raise awareness about the reality of human 
                                    trafficking and aims to stop it from happening through education and community events such as this 5k. Anti-human trafficking is a social
                                    justice issue near to Hannah's heart and this passion has recently overflowed in the form of starting a business in which a portion of the
                                    proceeds will go to Unbound and other organizations fighting human-trafficking. 
                                    It's a small made-to-order dessert business and you can visit her website <a href="http://www.just-desserts.xyz" target="_blank">here</a>

                                        high school and since they live in different states they aren't able to see each other often but when they do it's a great time!

                                            musicals we likely won't be seeing that one again.</p>
                                            <p>In the midst of our weekends, Joey was given the opportunity to speak to a group of young men about stewardship. 
                                            It's a topic he's really passionate about and it was a blessing to be able to share his thoughts with others. 
                                            It's something he's always willing to talk about so definitely ask him about it if you're curious. Maybe he'll send you 
                                            his notes! He's been told that he has teaching & writing in his genes and is starting to believe it. 
                                            Both of his parents recently released books that are now available online! You can view the first one

                                            We are incredibly thankful for this life we get to live on mission with God and in partnership with His people and during
